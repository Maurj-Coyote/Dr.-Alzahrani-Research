            <h2>About the Lab</h2>
            <p>The Research Lab of AI, Quantum, Fusion Energy, and Semiconductors (AQFS) is a multidisciplinary research
                and learning environment that empowers students to engage with the foundational technologies of the
                future. Through guided research, simulation-based exploration, and access to advanced computational
                tools, the lab supports hands-on student involvement across four critical domains: Artificial
                Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Fusion Energy, and Semiconductors.</p>
            <p>By fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, connecting students with faculty mentors, and engaging
                with national laboratories, academic partners, and industry stakeholders, AQFS advances both educational
                outcomes and applied research aligned with national priorities.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Purpose and Impact</h2>
            <p>AQFS was created in response to the growing national shortage of skilled professionals in science and
                technology fields essential to national security, energy innovation, and advanced computing. With rapid
                developments in artificial intelligence, quantum information science, nuclear fusion, and
                microelectronics, there is a pressing need to prepare students for high-demand careers that contribute
                to global competitiveness and public safety.</p>
            <p>The lab addresses this challenge by providing early access to research environments, supporting federally
                aligned projects—including those funded by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF),
                Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Defense (DoD)—and helping students develop the critical
                thinking, technical expertise, and interdisciplinary fluency needed for emerging STEM careers.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the discipline of building systems that can
                perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence—such as understanding language, recognizing images,
                making decisions, and learning from experience. Rather than explicitly programming a solution for every
                situation, AI systems use data to find patterns and improve performance over time.</p>
            <p>At its core, AI involves training mathematical models, called algorithms, on large datasets. These models
                "learn" to recognize relationships within the data and make informed predictions or decisions. For
                example, AI can be used to diagnose diseases from medical images, detect cybersecurity threats in real
                time, or guide autonomous vehicles.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Learn:</strong> Students at AQFS will be introduced to the key pillars of
                modern AI: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, and natural language processing.
                The program begins with intuitive, visual explanations of how models are trained and evaluated, and
                gradually progresses to more advanced topics like deep learning and algorithmic bias.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Train machine learning models using real-world datasets</li>
                <li>Build applications that perform image or text recognition</li>
                <li>Use platforms such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for model development</li>
                <li>Discuss ethical AI and fairness in data-driven systems</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Quantum computing is an emerging field that uses the principles of quantum
                mechanics to solve problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. While traditional computers
                use bits (which are either 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in a combination of 0
                and 1 at the same time—a concept known as superposition. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning
                their states are linked, allowing operations on one qubit to affect another, even over distance.</p>
            <p>This unique behavior allows quantum computers to evaluate many possible outcomes at once, offering
                exponential speedups for certain classes of problems, such as simulating chemical reactions or breaking
                cryptographic codes.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Learn:</strong> AQFS introduces students to quantum concepts in an accessible
                way, beginning with visual models and interactive simulations of superposition, entanglement, and
                quantum gates. Students learn the limitations of classical computation and how quantum algorithms differ
                fundamentally.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulate quantum circuits using beginner-friendly platforms like IBM Qiskit</li>
                <li>Explore how quantum algorithms solve problems in optimization and encryption</li>
                <li>Understand the relevance of quantum computing to national security and secure communications</li>
                <li>Learn how quantum technologies may disrupt current systems and how to prepare for it</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h3>Fusion Energy</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a
                heavier nucleus, releasing an enormous amount of energy. It is the same reaction that powers the sun.
                Unlike nuclear fission (used in conventional power plants), fusion produces no long-lived radioactive
                waste and carries no risk of meltdown. The fuel sources—such as hydrogen isotopes—are abundant and
                globally available.</p>
            <p>Fusion has long been considered the “holy grail” of energy because it is clean, safe, and nearly
                limitless. Achieving controlled fusion on Earth requires creating and confining extremely hot plasma
                (over 100 million degrees Celsius), which presents major scientific and engineering challenges.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Learn:</strong> Students explore the physics of fusion reactions, including
                concepts such as plasma confinement, magnetic fields, and energy balance. They examine how fusion
                systems are designed, how energy is transferred, and how modern computing helps scientists simulate
                these reactions before building physical prototypes.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use computational models to simulate plasma behavior and reactor dynamics</li>
                <li>Learn the differences between tokamak, stellarator, and inertial confinement designs</li>
                <li>Study how energy is transferred from fusion reactions into usable electricity</li>
                <li>Analyze how fusion could support secure, domestic energy systems and space operations</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h3>Semiconductors</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Semiconductors are materials that partially conduct electricity and are used
                to build electronic components such as transistors, microprocessors, and memory chips. These components
                form the backbone of every modern electronic device—from smartphones and laptops to aircraft and
                advanced weapons systems.</p>
            <p>At the atomic level, semiconductors can be engineered to allow or block current flow depending on the
                voltage applied. This property allows them to act as switches and amplifiers in circuits. Manufacturing
                semiconductors involves multiple complex steps, including doping (adding impurities), etching, and
                photolithography—all conducted in ultra-clean environments known as cleanrooms.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Learn:</strong> Students begin by exploring the physics behind semiconductor
                materials such as silicon and gallium arsenide. They are then introduced to transistor architecture,
                chip layout, and the global logistics behind fabrication and distribution.</p>
            <p><strong>What Students Will Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulate transistor switching behavior and basic logic gates</li>
                <li>Explore how integrated circuits (ICs) are designed and tested</li>
                <li>Understand how semiconductors enable sensors, processors, and memory</li>
                <li>Study how microelectronics intersects with defense, supply chain security, and global
                    competitiveness</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
